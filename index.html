            <h2>My First Hackathon Experience</h2>

            <p>Participating in my first hackathon was an unforgettable experience. It was an intense 48 hours of coding, brainstorming, and collaboration with like-minded individuals. My team and I worked on an AI-powered scheduling tool to optimize productivity for university students. It was challenging, but we learned so much about teamwork and rapid prototyping.</p>
            <p>The adrenaline of pushing through sleepless nights and the excitement of seeing our project come together is something I'll never forget. We didn't win the competition, but the experience was worth more than any prize. It solidified my passion for coding and teamwork.</p>

            <h2>Balancing Studies and Personal Projects</h2>
            <p class="post-info">September 20, 2024 by Christophe Marcellus</p>

            <p>As a computer science student, balancing coursework and personal projects can be tough. I’ve always been eager to work on side projects that let me apply the concepts I learn in class, but juggling that with deadlines is a real challenge. My latest project involves building a weather forecasting app using Python and various APIs, which has been a great way to practice integrating third-party services.</p>
            <p>Despite the workload, I’ve found that dedicating a few hours every weekend to personal projects not only helps me build my portfolio but also gives me a break from academic stress. It’s all about finding the right balance and staying motivated.</p>
